# TipTracker
Golang console application for tracking how much a delivery driver makes in a given shift

Having worked as a delivery driver in the past, I had an idea for an app that would keep track of how much I had made on a shift, instead of just writing it down and adding it all myself. This application will do just that. Below is some information for those who haven't worked as a delivery driver, if you're curious roughly how much a driver would make on a single shift. The averages are rough estimates from working as a driver for almost 4 years.

---------------------------------------------------------------

Average deliveries in a 6 hour shift:  10

Average tip for a standard delivery: $3-4

Mileage refers to how much we were given in gas compensation, per delivery: (as of 09/2017) $1.23
